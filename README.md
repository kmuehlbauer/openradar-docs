# Openradar Projects Documentation 

This repo hosts the source of https://docs.openradarscience.org. 

In the same time it acts as a parent RTD repo for other openradar projects, 
like https://github.com/openradar/xradar.

To add your project, just open an issue with a link to the projects RTD url or 
add your project to [docs/projects.md](https://github.com/openradar/openradar-docs/blob/main/docs/projects.md).

The maintainers will take care of hooking your project's documentation into https://docs.openradarscience.org.
